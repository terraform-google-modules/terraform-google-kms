# Google KMS Terraform Module

Simple Cloud KMS module that allows managing a keyring, zero or more keys in the keyring, and IAM role bindings on individual keys.

The resources/services/activations/deletions that this module will create/trigger are:

- Create a KMS keyring in the provided project
- Create zero or more keys in the keyring
- Create IAM role bindings for owners, encrypters, decrypters

## Compatibility
This module is meant for use with Terraform v1.3+ and tested using Terraform v1.10+.
 If you haven't
[upgraded](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html) and need a Terraform
0.12.x-compatible version of this module, the last released version
intended for Terraform 0.12.x is [v1.2.0](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/-kms/google/v1.2.0).

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "kms" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/kms/google"
  version = "~> 4.1"

  project_id         = "<PROJECT ID>"
  location           = "europe"
  keyring            = "sample-keyring"
  keys               = ["foo", "spam"]
  set_owners_for     = ["foo", "spam"]
  owners = [
    "group:one@example.com,group:two@example.com",
    "group:one@example.com",
  ]
}
```

Functional examples are included in the
[examples](./examples/) directory.

| labels | Labels, provided as a map | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| location | Location for the keyring. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| owners | List of comma-separated owners for each key declared in set\_owners\_for. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| prevent\_destroy | Set the prevent\_destroy lifecycle attribute on keys. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| project\_id | Project id where the keyring will be created. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| purpose | The immutable purpose of the CryptoKey. Default value is ENCRYPT\_DECRYPT. See purpose reference (https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.keyRings.cryptoKeys#CryptoKeyPurpose) for possible inputs. | `string` | `"ENCRYPT_DECRYPT"` | no |
